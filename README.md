Logging bot for kaboom

Shitty project, but hey, it works at least (or worked when I used it).

Probably lots of exploits, I don't recommend to use it.

It's outdated of course.

It's not chunkban protected, doesn't even have command block core. I was just playing with websockets and wanted to test what I can do with it how it works, etc. just exploring it.

Also the Minecraft chat color parser is broken, not correctly created.
